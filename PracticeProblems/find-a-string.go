//Problem statement : Given the matrix(2-D array) of characters and a string.
//Find whether the given string is present or not.
//Constraints : You can traverse in any of the directions to find a string (i.e. left/right/up/down)
//Constraints : You cannot take two different directions to find a given string.
// So, the matrix which has a string only in zig zag order should return false.

var FindAString = func(str string, matrix [][]rune) bool {

	return false
}
